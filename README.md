Composite:  Composite was used so that the Group and User can be grouped together to be added to the treeView.

Observer:   The observer pattern was used to attach observers to each of the user's followers.  Whenever a tweet is posted,
            the tweet would be posted to each of the observer's view.

Visitor:    The visitor pattern was used to visit through all the users that were created and to add all messages to an
            array to be counted.

Singleton:  Singleton was used so that only one instance of the admin class could be made.  The admin class controls most of
            what happens behind the scenes.  This is in the Admin class under application.admin
